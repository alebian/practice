## Introduction

To crack the coding interview, you need to prepare with real interview questions. You must practice on real problems and learn their patterns.

The focus of Cracking the Coding Interview is algorithm, coding and design questions. Why? Because while you can and will be asked behavioral questions, the answers will be as varied as your resume. Likewise, while many firms will ask so-called "trivia" questions (e.g., "What is a virtual function?"), the skills developed through practicing these questions are limited to very specific bits of knowledge.

## The interview process

Once you are selected for an interview, you usually go through a screening interview. This is typically conducted over the phone. College candidates who attend top schools may have these interviews in-person. The "screening" interview often involves coding and algorithms questions, and the bar can be just as high as it is for in-person interviews. If you're unsure whether or not the interview will be technical, ask your recruiting coordinator what position your interviewer holds. An engineer will usually perform a technical interview.

You typically do one or two screening interviewers before being brought on-site. In an on-site interview round, you usually have 4 to 6 in-person interviews. One of these will be over lunch. The lunch interview is usually not technical, and the interviewer may not even submit feedback. This is a good person to discuss your interests with and to ask about the company culture. Your other interviews will be mostly technical and will involve a combination of coding and algorithm questions. You should also expect some questions about your resume.

Afterwards, the interviewers meet to discuss your performance and/or submit written feedback. At most companies, your recruiter should respond to you within a week with an update on your status. If you have waited more than a week, you should follow up with your recruiter. If your recruiter does not respond, this does nof mean that you are rejected (at least not at any major tech company, and almost any other company). Follow up with your recruiter if you expect a delay, but be respectful when you do. Recruiters are just like you. They get busy and forgetful too.

There are some differences in broad terms across companies. Web-based companies are more likely to ask system design questions, and a company using databases heavily is more likely to ask you database questions. Most questions, however, fall into the broad "data structures and algorithms" category and could be asked by any company.

Most recruiters will probably tell you that candidates are evaluated on four aspects: prior experience, culture fit, coding skills, and analytical ability. These four components are certainly all in play, but typically, the decision comes down to your coding skills and your analytical ability (or intelligence). However, just because the decision usually comes down to coding and algorithm skills doesn't mean you should overlook the other two as factors. At bigger tech companies, your prior experience tends not to be a direct deciding factor once you're actually interviewing, but it may bias an interviewer's perception of the rest of your interview. For example, if you demonstrate brilliance when you discuss some tricky program you wrote, your interviewer is more likely to think, "Wow, she's brilliant!". And once he's decided that you're smart, he's more likely to subconsciously overlook your little mistakes. Interviewing, after all, is not an exact science. Preparing for "softer" questions is well worth your time.

It's not unusual for a candidate to get rejected because they appear too arrogant, argumentative, or defensive.

Spend some time preparing for questions about your resume.

Rejection is not a life sentence. You can almost always reapply within a year, and many candidates get offers from companies that previously rejected them.

One of the most pervasive—and dangerous—rumors is that candidates need to get every question right. That's not even close to true. First, responses to interview questions shouldn't be thought of as "correct" or "incorrect." When I evaluate how someone performed in an interview, I never ask myself, how many questions did they get right? Rather, it's about how optimal your final solution was, how long it took you to get there, and how clean your code was. It's not a binary right vs. wrong; there are a range of factors. Second, your performance is evaluated in comparison to other candidates. For example, if you solve a question optimally in 15 minutes, and someone else solves an easier question in five minutes, did that person do better than you? Maybe, but maybe not. If you are asked really easy questions, then you might be expected to get optimal solutions really quickly. But if the questions are hard, then a number of mistakes are expected.

Software engineers and those in similar positions typically dress less formally. This is reflected in the appropriate interview attire. A good rule of thumb for any interview is to dress one small notch better than the employees in your position.

|       | Start-Ups                                                 | Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc                  | Non-Tech Companies (including banks)                  |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Men   | Khakis, slacks, or nice jeans. Polo shirt or dress shirt. | Khakis, slacks, or nice jeans. Polo shirt or dress shirt. | Suit, no tie. (Consider bringing a tie just in case.) |
| Women | Khakis, slacks, or nice jeans. Nice top or sweater.       | Khakis, slacks, or nice jeans. Nice top or sweater.       | Suit, or nice slacks with a nice top                  |

These are just good advisements, and you should consider the culture of the company with which you're interviewing. If you are interviewing for a Program Manager, Dev Lead, or any role closer to management or the business side, you should lean towards the more dressy side.


### Top 10 mistakes

1. Practicing on a Computer: Put away the compiler and get out the old pen and paper. Use a compiler only to verify your solutions after you've written and hand-tested your code.

2. Not Rehearsing Behavioral Questions: Look over your projects and positions and rehearse your key stories.

3. Not Doing a Mock Interview

4. Trying to Memorize Solutions: It's much more effective to try to struggle through the problems in this book yourself, without flipping to the solutions.This will help you develop strategies to approach new problems. Even if you review fewer problems in the end, this kind of preparation will go much further. Quality beats quantity.

5. Not Solving Problems Out Loud

6. Rushing: this leads to mistakes and suggests that you are careless. Go slowly and methodically, testing often and thinking through the problem thoroughly. In the end, you'll finish the problem in less time and with fewer mistakes.

7. Sloppy Coding: When you write code, imagine you're writing for realworld maintainability. Break code into sub-routines, and design data structures to link appropriate data.

8. Not Testing: When you finish writing code in an interview,"run" (or walk through) the code to test it. Or, on more complicated problems, test the code while writing it.

9. Fixing Mistakes Carelessly: The important thing is that when you find a bug, you think through why it occurred before fixing it.

10. Giving Up: It's important that you step up and eagerly meet a tricky problem head-on. After all, remember that interviews are supposed to be hard. It shouldn't be a surprise when you get a really tough problem.

### Frequently asked questions

#### Should I tell my interviewer if I know a question?

Yes! You should definitely tell your interviewer if you've previously heard the question. This seems silly to some people—if you already know the question (and answer), you could ace the question, right? Not quite. Here's why we strongly recommend that you tell your interviewer that you've heard the problem before:

1. Big honesty points. This shows a lot of integrity—that's huge! Remember that the interviewer is evaluating you as a potential teammate. I don't know about you, but I personally prefer to work with honest people.

2. The question might have changed ever so slightly. You don't want to risk repeating the wrong answer.

3. If you easily belt out the right answer, it's obvious to the interviewer. They know how difficult a problem is supposed to be. If you instead try to pretend to struggle through a problem, you may very well wind up "struggling" too much and coming off unqualified.

#### What language should I use?

Many people will tell you to use whatever language you're most comfortable with, but ideally you want to use a language that your interviewer is comfortable with. I'd usually recommend coding in either C, C++ or Java, as the vast majority of interviewers will be comfortable in one of these languages.

## Behind the scenes

### Microsoft

Microsoft wants smart people. Geeks. People who are passionate about technology. You probably won't be tested on the ins and outs of C++ APIs, but you will be expected to write code on the board.

#### Definitely Prepare:

"Why do you want to work for Microsoft?" In this question, Microsoft wants to see that you're passionate about technology, A great answer might be, "I've been using Microsoft software as long as I can remember, and I'm really impressed at how Microsoft manages to create a product that is universally excellent. For example, I've been using Visual Studio recently to learn game programming, and its APIs are excellent." Note how this shows a passion for technology!

#### What's Unique:

You'll only reach the hiring manager if you've done well, so if you do, that's a great sign!

### Amazon

Amazon's recruiting process typically begins with two phone screens in which a candidate interviews with a specific team. A small portion of the time, a candidate may have three or more interviews, which can indicate either that one of their interviewers wasn't convinced or that they are being considered for a different team or profile. In more unusual cases, such as when a candidate is local or has recently interviewed for a different position, a candidate may only do one phone screen. The engineer who interviews you will usually ask you to write simple code via a shared document editor, such as CollabEdit. They will also often ask a broad set of questions to
explore what areas of technology you're familiar with.

Next, you fly to Seattle for four or five interviews with one or two teams that have selected you based on your resume and phone interviews. You will have to code on a whiteboard, and some interviewers will stress other skills. Interviewers are each assigned a specific area to probe and may seem very different from each other. They cannot see the other feedback until they have submitted their own, and they are discouraged from discussing it until the hiring meeting. The "bar raiser" interviewer is charged with keeping the interview bar high. They attend special training and will interview candidates outside their group in order to balance out the group itself.

#### Definitely Prepare:

Amazon is a web-based company, and that means they care about scale. Make sure you prepare for scalability questions. You don't need a background in distributed systems to answer these questions. See our recommendations in the Scalability and Memory Limits chapter. Additionally, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object oriented design. Check out the Object-Oriented Design chapter for sample questions and suggestions.

#### What's Unique:

The Bar Raiser is brought in from a different team to keep the bar high. You need to impress both this person and the hiring manager.

### Google

The interview is not terribly different from Microsoft's or Amazon's. A Google engineer performs the first phone screen, so expect tough technical questions. These questions may involve coding, sometimes via a shared document. Candidates are typically held to the same standard and are asked similar questions on phone screens as in on-site interviews. On your on-site interview, you'll interview with four to six people, one of whom will be a lunch interviewer. Interviewer feedback is kept confidential from the other interviewers, so you can be assured that you enter each interview with blank slate. Your lunch interviewer doesn't submit feedback, so this is a great opportunity to ask honest questions.

#### Definitely Prepare:

As a web-based company, Google cares about how to design a scalable system. So, make sure you prepare for questions from "Scalability and Memory Limits." Additionally, many Google interviewers will ask questions involving Bit Manipulation, so you are advised to brush up on these topics as well.

#### What's Different:

Your interviewers do not make the hiring decision. Rather, they enter feedback which is passed to a hiring committee. The hiring committee recommends a decision which can be—though rarely is—rejected by Google executives.

### Apple

Much like the company itself, Apple's interview process has minimal bureaucracy. The interviewers will be looking for excellent technical skills, but a passion for the position and the company is also very important. While it's not a prerequisite to be a Mac user, you should at least be familiar with the system.

The interview process usually begins with a recruiter phone screen to get a basic sense of your skills, followed up by a series of technical phone screens with team members. Once you're invited on campus, you'll typically be greeted by the recruiter who provides an overview of the process. You will then have 6-8 interviews with members of the team with which you're interviewing, as well as key people with whom your team works. You can expect a mix of 1-on-1 and 2-on-1 interviews. Be ready to code on a whiteboard and make sure all of your thoughts are clearly communicated. Lunch is with your potential future manager and appears more casual, but it is still an interview. Each interviewer usually focuses on a different area and is discouraged from sharing feedback with other interviewers unless there's something they want subsequent interviewers to drill into.

#### Definitely Prepare:

If you know what team you're interviewing with, make sure you read up on that product. What do you like about it? What would you improve? Offering specific recommendations can show your passion for the job.

#### What's Unique:

Apple does 2-on-1 interviews often, but don't get stressed out about them-it's the same as a 1-on-1 interview! Also, Apple employees are huge Apple fans. You should show this same passion in your interview.

### Facebook

Though Facebook's online engineering puzzles get a lot of hype, they're merely one more way to get noticed. You can still apply without solving these puzzles, through the traditional avenues like an online job application or your university career fair. Once selected for an interview, candidates will generally do a minimum of two phone screens. Local candidates, however, will often do just one interview before being invited on-site. Phone screens will be technical and will involve coding, usually via Etherpad or another online document editor. If you are in college and are interviewing on your campus, you will also do coding. This will be done either on a whiteboard (if one is available) or on a sheet of paper.

During your on-site interview, you will interview primarily with other software engineers, but hiring managers are also involved whenever they are available. All interviewers have gone through comprehensive interview training, and who you interview with has no bearing on your odds of getting an offer. Each interviewer is given a "role" during the on-site interviews, which helps ensure that there are no repetitive questions and that they get a holistic picture of a candidate. Questions are broken down into algorithm / coding skills, architecture / design skills, and the ability to be successful in Facebook's fast-paced environment.

Facebook looks for "ninja skills"-the ability to hack together an elegant and scalable solution using any language of choice.

### Definitely Prepare:

The youngest of the "elite" tech companies, Facebook wants developers with an entrepreneurial spirit. In your interviews, you should show that you love to build stuff fast.

### What's Unique:

Facebook interviews developers for the company "in general" not for a specific team. If you are hired, you will go through a six-week "bootcamp" which will help ramp you up in the massive code base. You'll get mentorship from senior devs, learn best practices, and, ultimately, get a greater flexibility in choosing a project than if you were assigned to a project in your interview.

## Behavioral questions

I recommend filling in the following "preparation grid"as shown below:

| Common Questions         | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 | Project 4 |
|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Most Challenging         |           |           |           |           |
| What You Learned         |           |           |           |           |
| Most Interesting         |           |           |           |           |
| Hardest Bug              |           |           |           |           |
| Enjoyed Most             |           |           |           |           |
| Conflicts with Teammates |           |           |           |           |

In your interview, when you're asked about a project, you'll be able to come up with an appropriate story effortlessly. Study this grid before your interview.

I recommend reducing each story to just a couple of keywords that you can write in each cell. This will make the grid easier to study and remember. If you're doing a phone interview, you should have this grid out in front of you. When each story has just a couple of keywords to trigger your memory, it will be much easier to give a fluid response than if you're trying to re-read a paragraph.

It may also be useful to extend this grid to"softer" questions, such as conflicts on a team, failures, or times you had to persuade someone. Questions like these are very common outside of strictly software engineer roles, such as dev lead, PM or even testing role. If you are applying for one of these positions, I would recommend making a second grid covering these softer areas.

When answering these questions, you're not just trying to find a story that matches their question. You're telling them about yourself. Think deeply about what each story communicates about you.

### What are your weaknesses?

When asked about your weaknesses, give a real weakness! Answers like "My greatest weakness is that I work too hard" tell your interviewer that you're arrogant and/or won't admit to your faults. No one wants to work with someone like that. A better answer conveys a real, legitimate weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it. For example: "Sometimes, I don't have a very good attention to detail. While that's good because it lets me execute quickly, it also means that I sometimes make careless mistakes. Because of that, I make sure to always have someone else double check my work."

### What was the most challenging part of that project?

When asked what the most challenging part was, don't say "I had to learn a lot of new languages and technologies." This is the "cop out" answer when you don't know what else to say. It tells the interviewer that nothing was really very hard.

### What questions should you ask the interviewer?

Most interviewers will give you a chance to ask them questions. The quality of your questions will be a factor, whether subconsciously or consciously, in their decisions. Some questions may come to you during the interview, but you can—and should— prepare questions in advance. Doing research on the company or team may help you with preparing questions. Questions can be divided into three different categories.

#### Genuine Questions

These are the questions you actually want to know the answers to. Here are a few ideas of questions that are valuable to many candidates:

1. "How much of your day do you spend coding?"
2. "How many meetings do you have every week?
3. "What is the ratio of testers to developers to program managers? What is the interaction like? How does project planning happen on the team?"

#### Insightful Questions

These questions are designed to demonstrate your deep knowledge of programming or technologies, and they also demonstrate your passion for the company or product.

1. "I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y?"
2. "Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits like A, B, C, but many companies choose not to use it because of issue D.

#### Passion Questions

These questions are designed to demonstrate your passion for technology. They show that you're interested in learning and will be a strong contributor to the company.

1. "I'm very interested in scalability. Did you come in with a background in this, or what opportunities are there to learn about it?"
2. "I'm not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like a very interesting solution. Could you tell me a bit more about how it works?"

### Handling Behavioral Question

Remember the following advice when responding to questions.

1. Be Specific, Not Arrogant.
2. Limit Details: Stay light on details and just state the key points. That is, consider something like this: "By examining the most common user behavior and applying the Rabin-Karp algorithm, I designed a new algorithm to reduce search from 0(n) to 0(log n) in 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you'd like.'This demonstrates the key points while letting your interviewer ask for more details if he wants to.
